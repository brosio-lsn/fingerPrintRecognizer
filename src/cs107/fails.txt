Regarding the bonus:
1)We wrote the bestConstants method to find the constants giving us the best percentage of successful tests.
2)Almost all the tests have been improved and new ones have been written in the main file. The major ones are testRandomComparisons,
testSuccesComparissons, testFailComparisons and all the methods we wrote in the fingerprint file have their own tests.
